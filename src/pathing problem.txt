Automatic platform pathing methods

Currently known data:
- Player minimap coordinates
- Platform start, end coordinates

What we want to achieve:
Given current player coordinates and platform start, end coordinates, compute a way to reach
platform A to platform B

Method 1 - Standard jumps between platforms
1. Compute Euclidean Square distance between all platform starts and ends
2. If distance between two points is less that jump distance(to be determined), map two each coordinates movable by jumps

Method 2 - Utilizing vertical super jump
1. Find vertical overlaps of 2 different platforms.
2. Calculate vertical distance between platform
3. If distance is less that super jump range, map as reachable by superjump/fall

Method 3 - Utilizing ladders/ropes


Method 4 - Utilizing glide in large platforms
