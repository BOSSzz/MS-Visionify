Proposing a heuristical way to approximate the effectiveness of a given path

One of the core features of the bot is deemed to be the ability to plan an efficient path given the start, end coordinates
of each platform and its respective solutions(inter-platform movement methods).
In order to select the most efficient path, a method for measuring the effectiveness of paths needs to be implemented.

Here are some rules we assume to be true during evaluation

1. A platform's number of mobs at any given time is proportional to its length.
2. The cost of solutions, in biggest to least order is:
    dbljmp_max > dbljmp_half > drop > jmpl = jmpr

Platform efficiency is defined as length of platform multiplied by mob constant M

We can now design a heuristical function where for a given solution which includes solutions S and platforms P, its efficiency
can be defined the sum of solution cost subtracted from sum of Platform efficiency

S(efficiency) = -Sigma(solution_cost) + Sigma(Platform_Efficiency)

The cost coefficients for each solutions is as follows:

dbljmp_max     5
dbljmp_half    3
drop           2
jmpl,jmpr      1

Practical calculation of efficiency with actual platforms

Each platform, if longer than 5 pixels, is subdivided into subplatforms of length 5
From start subplatform SPs in platform Ps, traverse through other connected subplatforms and solutions
Keep track of number of subplatforms and solutions used during traversal
If within current platform and next platform goal is decided, movement direction within the current platform cannot be changed
Terminate when start platform is reached and calculate efficiency for each path found
Select path with highest efficiency
